imgui-console aims to provide a console that allows the client to easly modify application variables, execute commands and run scripts at run-time. It started as a widget to test the [csys library](https://github.com/rmxbalanque/csys) during its development. While it was developed as an example use case for _csys_, I believe it can be useful for other projects.

## Features
- Smart scrolling, timetamps, log filtering, colored console output.
- Console settings and visuals are preserved through sessions. (Information stored in the imgui.ini)
- All features that _csys_ provides. (Tab completion, commands, variables, scripts, etc)

## Integration
