imgui-console
---
A starting point for my own dear imgui console widget.
See [Inspiration](https://github.com/AaronAppel/imgui-console/edit/master/README.md#inspiration-and-credits) section for credits.

I am aiming to combine the awesome search and hints features of RedSkittleFox's [imgui-console](https://github.com/RedSkittleFox/imgui-console), with rmxbalanque's excellent UI and scripts execution [imgui-console](https://github.com/rmxbalanque/imgui-console) to get a powerful development console. Add in the genius registry edit from cstom4994's [imgui_lua_inspector](https://github.com/cstom4994/imgui_lua_inspector) and the result would be a more complete and super powerful devlopment console.

Each are a little dated and have some buggy or unintitive behaviour for me so I ouwld like to improve on that.
Afterwards I hope to add my own unique features, if I find the time.

## My Changes
- "//" Comment support in .script files

## Future Features Wishlist
#### Output Search CTRL + F:
- Character highlighting
- Navigation between results

#### Advanced Search:
- Case sensitivity
- Exact versus fuzzy find/matching
- Regex matching

#### Registry Tab:
- View registered variables and commands information
- Edit registery entries
- Execute registery entries
- Reload registry at runtime (hot reload support)
